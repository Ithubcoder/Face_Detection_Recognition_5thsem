## Overview

The **Face Detection and Recognition System** is a Python-based project that identifies and recognizes faces in real-time using image processing and machine learning techniques. This project utilizes OpenCV for image processing, LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) for face recognition, and Python for the overall implementation.

### Key Features

- **Face Data Collection**: Capture and store face data for training.
- **Face Detection**: Detect faces in real-time using a webcam or images.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognize faces using LBPH face recognizer.
- **Attendance System**: Mark attendance based on recognized faces.

## Features
- **Face Data Collection**: Capture face images to build a dataset.
- **Face Detection**: Detect faces in images or via webcam.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognize individual faces using the LBPH algorithm.
- **Attendance System**: Mark attendance based on recognized faces in real time.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV for image processing and face detection.
  - LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) for face recognition.
  - NumPy for numerical computations.
  - Pandas (optional) for attendance tracking.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect images of individuals and store them in a structured dataset.
2. **Training**:
   - Train the LBPH model on the collected dataset to recognize faces.
3. **Detection and Recognition**:
   - Detect faces in images or via webcam and recognize them using the trained model.
4. **Attendance Tracking** (optional):
   - Log the recognized individuals into an attendance database.

## Possible Enhancements
- Add deep learning models like CNNs for improved accuracy.
- Integrate a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).
- Expand features to include group detection and recognition.
- Enhance model to work with low-light or occluded face data.
