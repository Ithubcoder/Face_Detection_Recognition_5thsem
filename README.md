## Overview

The **Face Detection and Recognition System** is a Python-based project that identifies and recognizes faces in real-time using image processing and machine learning techniques. This project utilizes OpenCV for image processing, LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) for face recognition, and Python for the overall implementation.

### Key Features

- **Face Data Collection**: Capture and store face data for training.
- **Face Detection**: Detect faces in real-time using a webcam or images.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognize faces using LBPH face recognizer.
- **Attendance System**: Mark attendance based on recognized faces.
